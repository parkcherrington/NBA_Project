# NBA_Project
This repository is a project that I am working on to bolster my programming and data science skills. I started this project for a school assignment but have continued it as a hobby. I have enjoyed adding to it and continue to come up with new ideas for this project.
It contains the following:
- A jupyter notebook that scrapes data from NBA.com and formats it into a .csv file to be used in other files.
- Another jupyter notebook that contains many data visualizations that I have made in order to explore the data and practice my graphics skills.
- Code for a shiny app that I have built that allows me to interact with dynamic charts and easily pull up data. 

If you have done something similar in the past or have a cool idea for my project, let me know! I welcome any collaboration!
